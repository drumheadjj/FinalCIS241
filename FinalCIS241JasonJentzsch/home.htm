<h2><body>
I'm an SEO expert! I'm a e-Commerce Seller, attending Edmond's Community College EdCC getting a two year Certificate in Web Design Cloud Server. I'm here learning to promote myself and others on the Internet. 
I became fascinated with SEO and Web design when I heard of two men who sold books to start with online.
</P>
<p>One became great at selling his books through SEO and became a search engine expert. He sold his site for enough money to retire but still focuses on SEO. 
The other grew to become the <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2018/03/06/jeff-bezos-unseats-bill-gates-forbes-2018-richest-billionaires-list/398877002/">richest man</a> 
in the world. He also owns the biggest retailer in the United States posssibly soon the world. Yes, it's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Best-Sellers/zgbs">Amazon</a> and its continuing to grow.
</P>
<p>I relocated to this area for opportunity in the high tech Seattle area. My focus is E-Commerce, designing sites, and using SEO strategies, to expand my own business. 
I'm excited to finish school sell products, and attend Amazon seminars and their programs available in this area. I then will teach others what I know through-out the Web.
